# SpaceX Project Bay

A modern frontend application built as an assignment task for a frontend interview. This project leverages SpaceX's public API to showcase various data points about SpaceX launches and missions. It features user authentication with Clerk, a beautiful UI built using Mantine, and state management powered by Zustand, all wrapped in a fast and optimized Vite-powered React application.
